In Boomi, you can compare two document cache values using scripting. Here's an example of how you can compare two document cache values in Boomi:

First, make sure you have set up the document cache in your Boomi process and have stored the values you want to compare in the cache.

Add a "Script" shape to your Boomi process after retrieving the document cache values.

Double-click on the "Script" shape to open the scripting editor.

In the scripting editor, select the scripting language you prefer (e.g., Groovy or JavaScript). For this example, let's use Groovy.

Write the script to retrieve the document cache values and compare them. Here's an example:

groovy code

def value1 = documentCache.get("cacheKey1")
def value2 = documentCache.get("cacheKey2")

if (value1 == value2) {
    // Values are equal
    // Perform your desired actions or transformations here
} else {
    // Values are not equal
    // Perform other actions or transformations here
}
In this example, cacheKey1 and cacheKey2 are the keys used to store the values in the document cache. You can replace them with your actual cache keys.

Save the script and close the scripting editor.

Continue building your Boomi process with the desired actions or transformations based on the comparison result.

By comparing the retrieved values from the document cache, you can take different actions or perform specific transformations in your Boomi process based on the comparison result.
