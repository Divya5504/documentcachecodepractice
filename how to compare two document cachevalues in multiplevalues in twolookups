To compare two document cache values in multiple lookups in Boomi, you can use scripting within a Data Process shape. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

Add a Data Process shape to your Boomi process.

Within the Data Process shape, select a scripting language (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript).

In the scripting language, you can access the document cache using the executionContext object.

groovy
Copy code
def docCache = executionContext.getDynamicDocumentProperty('cacheName') // Replace 'cacheName' with the actual name of your document cache

// Retrieve the values from the document cache using the lookup keys
def lookupValue1 = docCache['lookupKey1'] // Replace 'lookupKey1' with the first lookup key
def lookupValue2 = docCache['lookupKey2'] // Replace 'lookupKey2' with the second lookup key

// Compare the values from the document cache
if (lookupValue1 == lookupValue2) {
    // Values are equal
    // Add your desired logic here
} else {
    // Values are not equal
    // Add your desired logic here
}
Make sure to replace 'cacheName', 'lookupKey1', and 'lookupKey2' with the actual names of your cache and lookup keys.

Customize the logic inside the if and else blocks according to your requirements. You can perform any necessary operations or transformations based on the comparison result.

Save and deploy your Boomi process to test the comparison of the document cache values in the lookups.

Remember to adapt the code to the specific scripting language you choose and the structure of your Boomi process.
